# Kickstarter Module 1 Challenge

## An Analysis of Kickstarter Theater Campaigns:

### Purpose
Loiuse needs to launch a kickstarter campaign in order to produce a play. An analysis of prior campaigns was completed to provide Louise with information in order to complete her goal of $4000.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
An analysis was completed based on the launch date of the campaign. The dataset was first isolated to "theater" kickstarter campaigns in order to best reflect information most useful to Louise's needs.  The information was then broken down by month to verify when launching her campaign would give her the highest chance at success.

### Results
* The optimal time to launch a campaign is in the month of May.
* The frequency of success increases in May and the months immediately following.
* May  is by far the most popular month to launch theater campaigns

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
An analysis  was completed based on the amount($) of each campaign's goal. This information was then broken down on whether they were successfull or not.

### Results
* The goal amount for Louise closely matches both the highest success rates, as well as the amount of successful campaigns.

## Limitations and Challenges
The dataset does provide historical information of kickstarter campaigns, but may not include information that could heavily influence the success rate. Some examples may include:
* paid ad campaign for the kickstarter
* potential social media influence
* the history of the playwright,  such as prior success or notoriety

### Recommendation for additional information
* a breakdown and chart of the number of backers and the average donation
* an analysis of the length of a successful campaign
